## Project Overview

Building your personal website with Next.js, React, and TypeScript is overkill. I chose to do so because I much prefer 
dealing wth Next.js' file-based routing using the App Router. The ease of deploying to Vercel for free, instantly,
makes it a great choice for quick and low-cost products/proof-of-concepts. I also wanted to have a completed project using React
alongside Next.js. You can visit the site here: https://www.zackwalton.com/
